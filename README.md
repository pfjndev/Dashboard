# 2D Practical Work

### Problem Description: Dashboard for data presentation

## Folder Structure
<br>

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.

<br>

Inside the `src` folder:

    - dashboard is the main package.

    - Dashboard.java is the main executable.

<br>

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

<br>

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

<br>

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
