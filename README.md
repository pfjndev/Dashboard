## Getting Started

1) Clone the project and open it on your favourite editor.
2) Click run and wait for it be compiled.
3) A window should appear after compilation step is complete.

## Folder Structure
<br>

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.

<br>

Inside the `src` folder:

    - dashboard is the main package.

    - Dashboard.java is the main executable.

<br>

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

<br>

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

<br>

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
